# Super simple python alternative to pstree, prints the process tree for a given PID


import psutil as ps
import sys


def print_process_tree(pid: int):
    # Get the process object for the given PID
    process = ps.Process(pid)

    # Print the process tree recursively
    print_process_node(process, 0)


def print_process_node(process: ps.Process, level: int):
    # Print the process name with indentation based on level

    # Recursively print the children of the process
    for child in process.children():
        print_process_node(child, level + 1)


# Example usage: print the process tree of PID 1 (init process)
print_process_tree(int(sys.argv[1]))
