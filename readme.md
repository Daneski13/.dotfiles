# My Dot Files

Assumes ZSH is installed and set as the default shell.

Folder structure is a little weird as I'm using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage with symlinks. Top level folders are organized by topic while the contents will end up being relative to the home directory, ex. within `zsh` folder, `.zshrc` will be symlinked to `~/.zshrc`.

Very macOS centric at the moment as my primary machine is a MacBook.
